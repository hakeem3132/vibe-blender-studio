# 9. Server Dockerization

**Date:** 2025-11-22  
**Version:** 0.1.8  
**Tasks:** TASK-005_Dockerize_Server

## 🚀 Key Changes

### Infrastructure
- **Dockerfile**: Added file to build a lightweight image based on `python:3.10-slim`. The image contains all dependencies and server code.
- **Configuration**: Implemented `server/infrastructure/config.py`, which loads environment variables (`BLENDER_RPC_HOST`, `BLENDER_RPC_PORT`). This allows dynamic connection configuration (essential for Docker).
- **DI**: Updated `di.py` to inject configuration into `RpcClient`.

### Testing
- Verified connection from Docker container to Blender running on host (macOS) using `host.docker.internal`.

### Deployment
- The server is now ready for distribution as a Docker image, eliminating the need for local Python and Poetry installation by the end user (outside of development environment).
