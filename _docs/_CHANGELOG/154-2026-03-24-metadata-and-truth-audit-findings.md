# 154 - 2026-03-24: Metadata and truth-model audit findings

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Type**: Audit / Execution Backlog  
**Task**: TASK-114-03, TASK-114-04

---

## Summary

Completed the next audit pass after `TASK-113`, covering:

- metadata/discovery/public-surface drift
- verification/truth-model gaps

This wave still does not implement the fixes themselves, but it does turn the
remaining drift into a much more concrete backlog for the next code wave.

---

## Findings (high level)

- docs still overuse the older “mega tools / context optimization” framing
- metadata related-tool examples still encode older low-level/manual-first assumptions in some areas
- before/after verification patterns already exist, but the deterministic measure/assert layer is still missing
- the first measure/assert implementation wave should start with distance, dimensions, gap/contact, alignment, and overlap/intersection

---

## Files Modified (high level)

- `_docs/_TASKS/TASK-114-03*`
- `_docs/_TASKS/TASK-114-04*`
- `_docs/_CHANGELOG/README.md`
