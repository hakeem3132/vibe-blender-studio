# 7. Addon Architecture Refactor

**Date:** 2025-11-22  
**Version:** 0.1.6  
**Tasks:** TASK-003_4_Refactor_Addon_Architecture

## 🚀 Key Changes

### Blender Addon Architecture
Refactored addon directory structure to match Clean Architecture:

- **Application (`blender_addon/application/handlers/`)**
  - `scene.py`: Contains `SceneHandler` class (Application Logic). It took over code from the former `api/`.

- **Infrastructure (`blender_addon/infrastructure/`)**
  - `rpc_server.py`: Moved socket server code here (was in the root directory).

- **Entry Point (`blender_addon/__init__.py`)**
  - Now acts as Composition Root. Creates `SceneHandler` instance, initializes `rpc_server`, and registers handlers.

### File Structure
- Removed `blender_addon/api/` directory.
- Updated tests to new paths.

This change unifies architecture between Server (Client) and Addon (Server). Both components are now layered and testable.
