# TASK-085-04: Client Profiles and Guided Mode Presets

**Parent:** [TASK-085](./TASK-085_Session_Adaptive_Tool_Visibility.md)  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Depends On:** [TASK-085-02](./TASK-085-02_Visibility_Policy_Engine_and_Tagged_Providers.md)

---

## Objective

Introduce visibility presets for different clients and a guided-mode surface that reduces active action space without removing deeper capabilities from the repo.

## Completion Summary

This slice is now closed.

- explicit client profile presets exist for `legacy-flat`, `llm-guided`, `internal-debug`, and `code-mode-pilot`
- guided-mode diagnostics are computed from the canonical manifest + phase policy rather than ad hoc lists
- tests cover profile alignment and guided defaults

---

## Planned Work

- create:
  - `server/adapters/mcp/client_profiles.py`
  - `server/adapters/mcp/guided_mode.py`
  - `tests/unit/adapters/mcp/test_client_profiles.py`
- support profiles such as:
  - `legacy-flat`
  - `llm-guided`
  - `internal-debug`
  - `code-mode-pilot`

## Acceptance Criteria

- surface profiles can be selected without forking tool handler logic
- guided mode starts from a small entry surface, not by phase-filtering the entire catalog at once
- deeper capabilities remain available through search or alternate profiles

---

## Atomic Work Items

1. Align profile names with the server factory and versioning matrix.
2. Define exactly which providers and transforms each profile uses.
3. Keep `llm-guided` initial visibility intentionally tiny and centered on entry tools.
4. Add one golden test per profile for visible entry tools.
