# TASK-093-01-02: Tests and Docs Telemetry Model and OpenTelemetry Bootstrap

**Parent:** [TASK-093-01](./TASK-093-01_Telemetry_Model_and_OpenTelemetry_Bootstrap.md)  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Depends On:** [TASK-093-01-01](./TASK-093-01-01_Core_Telemetry_OpenTelemetry_Bootstrap.md)

---

## Objective

Add tests and documentation updates for **Telemetry Model and OpenTelemetry Bootstrap**.

## Completion Summary

This slice is now closed.

- in-memory exporter tests verify emitted spans and router-specific attributes
- public docs now describe OTEL bootstrap configuration and the current telemetry baseline

---

## Repository Touchpoints

- `tests/unit/`
- `_docs/`

---

## Planned Work

### Regression Scenarios (Required)

1. telemetry happy path: expected spans are emitted for target operations.
2. attribute completeness path: required custom attributes are present on spans.
3. diagnostics surface path: operational status reflects live profile/phase/task state.
4. error path: failures produce traceable error spans and diagnostics-safe output.

### Metrics To Capture

- required span coverage for target operations
- required attribute completeness ratio
- diagnostics payload freshness lag

### Documentation Deliverables

- update task-linked docs with a before/after summary tied to the captured metrics
- document exact test commands, fixtures, and profile/config used during validation
- record compatibility or migration notes when behavior differs between surfaces

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- all required regression scenarios are implemented and passing in CI/local test runs
- metrics are captured with baseline vs post-change values and attached to the task update
- docs include the regression matrix and explain expected behavior boundaries
- no untracked regressions are observed on related router/dispatcher/platform paths

---

## Atomic Work Items

1. Implement the required regression scenarios in focused unit/integration tests.
2. Run the target suites, collect metric outputs, and compare to baseline values.
3. Update docs with regression matrix, metric table, and migration/compatibility notes.
4. Verify adjacent surfaces for spillover regressions and document the result.
