# TASK-092-02-02: Tests and Docs Assistant Runner with Typed Result Wrappers

**Parent:** [TASK-092-02](./TASK-092-02_Assistant_Runner_with_Typed_Result_Wrappers.md)  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Depends On:** [TASK-092-02-01](./TASK-092-02-01_Core_Assistant_Runner_Typed_Result.md)

---

## Objective

Add tests and documentation updates for **Assistant Runner with Typed Result Wrappers**.

---

## Repository Touchpoints

- `tests/unit/`
- `_docs/`

---

## Planned Work

### Regression Scenarios (Required)

1. sampling-available happy path: assistant returns typed validated result envelope.
2. sampling-unavailable path: deterministic fallback contract is returned.
3. budget/masking path: policy limits and masking rules are enforced.
4. boundary path: assistant output cannot bypass router safety or inspection truth checks.

### Metrics To Capture

- typed result validation success rate
- fallback activation rate when sampling is unavailable
- policy violation count for assistant boundary rules (target: 0)

### Documentation Deliverables

- update task-linked docs with a before/after summary tied to the captured metrics
- document exact test commands, fixtures, and profile/config used during validation
- record compatibility or migration notes when behavior differs between surfaces

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- all required regression scenarios are implemented and passing in CI/local test runs
- metrics are captured with baseline vs post-change values and attached to the task update
- docs include the regression matrix and explain expected behavior boundaries
- no untracked regressions are observed on related router/dispatcher/platform paths

---

## Atomic Work Items

1. Implement the required regression scenarios in focused unit/integration tests.
2. Run the target suites, collect metric outputs, and compare to baseline values.
3. Update docs with regression matrix, metric table, and migration/compatibility notes.
4. Verify adjacent surfaces for spillover regressions and document the result.
