# TASK-097-04-02: Tests and Docs Inspection-Based Verification Integration

**Parent:** [TASK-097-04](./TASK-097-04_Inspection_Based_Verification_Integration.md)  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Depends On:** [TASK-097-04-01](./TASK-097-04-01_Core_Inspection_Verification_Integration.md)

---

## Objective

Add tests and documentation updates for **Inspection-Based Verification Integration**.

---

## Repository Touchpoints

- `tests/unit/`
- `_docs/`

---

## Planned Work

### Regression Scenarios (Required)

1. verification happy path: high-risk fixes pass postcondition checks via inspection contracts.
2. verification failure path: failed postconditions block success finalization and report cause.
3. inconclusive path: ambiguous inspection result escalates per policy instead of silent success.
4. regression path: verification hooks do not alter low-risk correction flow semantics.

### Metrics To Capture

- postcondition verification pass/fail/inconclusive distribution
- verification-to-finalization consistency rate
- false-success corrections after verification integration (target: 0)

### Documentation Deliverables

- update task-linked docs with a before/after summary tied to the captured metrics
- document exact test commands, fixtures, and profile/config used during validation
- record compatibility or migration notes when behavior differs between surfaces

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- all required regression scenarios are implemented and passing in CI/local test runs
- metrics are captured with baseline vs post-change values and attached to the task update
- docs include the regression matrix and explain expected behavior boundaries
- no untracked regressions are observed on related router/dispatcher/platform paths

---

## Atomic Work Items

1. Implement the required regression scenarios in focused unit/integration tests.
2. Run the target suites, collect metric outputs, and compare to baseline values.
3. Update docs with regression matrix, metric table, and migration/compatibility notes.
4. Verify adjacent surfaces for spillover regressions and document the result.
