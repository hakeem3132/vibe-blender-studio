# TASK-083-05-02: Tests and Docs Context, Session, and Execution Bridge

**Parent:** [TASK-083-05](./TASK-083-05_Context_Session_and_Execution_Bridge.md)  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Depends On:** [TASK-083-05-01](./TASK-083-05-01_Core_Context_Session_Execution_Bridge.md)

---

## Objective

Add tests and documentation updates for **Context, Session, and Execution Bridge**.

## Current State

Baseline bridge tests exist and pass for session helpers, execution report generation, sync compatibility, and router-aware direct execution reporting.

This slice is now closed. The broader elicitation/task/operations coverage now exists and validates the bridge against real downstream behavior.

---

## Repository Touchpoints

- `tests/unit/router/adapters/test_mcp_integration.py`
- `_docs/`

---

## Planned Work

### Regression Scenarios (Required)

1. session bridge happy path: context/session helpers persist and retrieve expected state.
2. execution report path: routed execution emits structured report with required fields.
3. sync compatibility path: legacy sync wrappers remain behaviorally stable.
4. error path: context bridge failures degrade safely without crashing tool execution.

### Metrics To Capture

- session state persistence pass rate
- execution report schema validation pass rate
- sync vs async behavior parity mismatches (target: 0)

### Documentation Deliverables

- update task-linked docs with a before/after summary tied to the captured metrics
- document exact test commands, fixtures, and profile/config used during validation
- record compatibility or migration notes when behavior differs between surfaces

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- all required regression scenarios are implemented and passing in CI/local test runs
- metrics are captured with baseline vs post-change values and attached to the task update
- docs include the regression matrix and explain expected behavior boundaries
- no untracked regressions are observed on related router/dispatcher/platform paths

---

## Atomic Work Items

1. Implement the required regression scenarios in focused unit/integration tests.
2. Run the target suites, collect metric outputs, and compare to baseline values.
3. Update docs with regression matrix, metric table, and migration/compatibility notes.
4. Verify adjacent surfaces for spillover regressions and document the result.
