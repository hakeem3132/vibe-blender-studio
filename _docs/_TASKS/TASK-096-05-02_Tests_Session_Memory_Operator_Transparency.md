# TASK-096-05-02: Tests and Docs Session Memory and Operator Transparency

**Parent:** [TASK-096-05](./TASK-096-05_Session_Memory_and_Operator_Transparency.md)  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Depends On:** [TASK-096-05-01](./TASK-096-05-01_Core_Session_Memory_Operator_Transparency.md)

---

## Objective

Add tests and documentation updates for **Session Memory and Operator Transparency**.

---

## Repository Touchpoints

- `tests/unit/`
- `_docs/`

---

## Planned Work

### Regression Scenarios (Required)

1. session memory happy path: confidence/policy context persists across related steps.
2. operator transparency path: surfaced policy context matches executed decision.
3. reset path: session clear/reset removes stale policy memory correctly.
4. regression path: transparency output never hides auto-fix/ask/block rationale.

### Metrics To Capture

- session context persistence consistency rate
- operator-facing decision transparency completeness ratio
- stale-policy-context incidents after reset (target: 0)

### Documentation Deliverables

- update task-linked docs with a before/after summary tied to the captured metrics
- document exact test commands, fixtures, and profile/config used during validation
- record compatibility or migration notes when behavior differs between surfaces

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- all required regression scenarios are implemented and passing in CI/local test runs
- metrics are captured with baseline vs post-change values and attached to the task update
- docs include the regression matrix and explain expected behavior boundaries
- no untracked regressions are observed on related router/dispatcher/platform paths

---

## Atomic Work Items

1. Implement the required regression scenarios in focused unit/integration tests.
2. Run the target suites, collect metric outputs, and compare to baseline values.
3. Update docs with regression matrix, metric table, and migration/compatibility notes.
4. Verify adjacent surfaces for spillover regressions and document the result.
