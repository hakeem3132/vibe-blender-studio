# TASK-095-03: Truth and Verification Handoff to Inspection Contracts

**Parent:** [TASK-095](./TASK-095_LaBSE_Semantic_Layer_Boundaries.md)  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Depends On:** [TASK-095-01](./TASK-095-01_Semantic_Responsibility_Policy_and_Code_Audit.md), [TASK-089-02](./TASK-089-02_Structured_Scene_Context_and_Inspection_Contracts.md), [TASK-089-03](./TASK-089-03_Structured_Mesh_Introspection_Contracts.md)

---

## Objective

Move truth and verification decisions onto structured inspection contracts instead of semantic confidence.

---

## Atomic Work Items

1. Identify every place where semantic confidence currently leaks into truth-like decisions.
2. Replace those decisions with explicit inspection contract checks.
3. Add tests proving scene truth no longer depends on semantic score alone.

| ID | Title | Focus |
|----|-------|-------|
| [TASK-095-03-01](./TASK-095-03-01_Core_Truth_Verification_Handoff_Inspection.md) | Core Truth and Verification Handoff to Inspection Contracts | Core implementation layer |

## Acceptance Criteria

- semantic confidence is not used as a proxy for scene truth

## Completion Summary

- inspection-based verification remains the source of truth for correction validation
- boundary tests now cover that high semantic confidence does not override contradictory inspection truth
