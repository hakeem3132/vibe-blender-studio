# TASK-113-05: Vision, Measurement, and Assertion Layer

**Parent:** [TASK-113](./TASK-113_Tool_Layering_Goal_First_And_Vision_Assertion_Strategy.md)  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Depends On:** TASK-113-03, TASK-113-04

---

## Objective

Define how visual interpretation, deterministic measurement, and explicit assertions should work together.

---

## Repository Touchpoints

- `_docs/_MCP_SERVER/README.md`
- `_docs/AVAILABLE_TOOLS_SUMMARY.md`
- `_docs/_PROMPTS/README.md`
- router boundary docs

---

## Planned Work

- define before/after multiview capture as a platform pattern
- define a measure/assert tool family
- define vision as interpretation support, not the final truth source

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- the repo has a documented answer to “how does the LLM know if the result is correct?”
- new verification work is guided by one documented architecture instead of ad hoc patches
**Completion Summary:** The docs now define the verification model explicitly: before/after multiview capture as a platform pattern, deterministic measure/assert as the truth layer, and vision as interpretation support rather than the final authority.
