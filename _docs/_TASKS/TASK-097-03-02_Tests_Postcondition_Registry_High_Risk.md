# TASK-097-03-02: Tests and Docs Postcondition Registry for High-Risk Fixes

**Parent:** [TASK-097-03](./TASK-097-03_Postcondition_Registry_for_High_Risk_Fixes.md)  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  
**Depends On:** [TASK-097-03-01](./TASK-097-03-01_Core_Postcondition_Registry_High_Risk.md)

---

## Objective

Add tests and documentation updates for **Postcondition Registry for High-Risk Fixes**.

---

## Repository Touchpoints

- `tests/unit/`
- `_docs/`

---

## Planned Work

### Regression Scenarios (Required)

1. registry lookup path: known high-risk correction families resolve to explicit postcondition entries.
2. no-registry path: non-registered correction families skip verification triggers predictably.
3. trigger gate path: verification trigger conditions respect risk class, correction type, and policy flags.
4. schema validity path: invalid or incomplete postcondition registry entries fail fast in tests.

### Metrics To Capture

- high-risk correction-family coverage in registry
- false trigger rate for non-registered corrections
- invalid registry entry detection count (target: explicit failures in tests)

### Documentation Deliverables

- update task-linked docs with a before/after summary tied to the captured metrics
- document exact test commands, fixtures, and profile/config used during validation
- record compatibility or migration notes when behavior differs between surfaces

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- all required regression scenarios are implemented and passing in CI/local test runs
- metrics are captured with baseline vs post-change values and attached to the task update
- docs include the regression matrix and explain expected behavior boundaries
- no untracked regressions are observed on related correction-policy and verification-trigger paths

---

## Atomic Work Items

1. Implement the required regression scenarios in focused unit/integration tests.
2. Run the target suites, collect metric outputs, and compare to baseline values.
3. Update docs with regression matrix, metric table, and migration/compatibility notes.
4. Verify adjacent surfaces for spillover regressions and document the result.
