# TASK-094-04-02: Tests and Docs Decision Memo and Documentation

**Parent:** [TASK-094-04](./TASK-094-04_Decision_Memo_and_Documentation.md)  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Depends On:** [TASK-094-04-01](./TASK-094-04-01_Core_Decision_Memo_Documentation.md)

---

## Objective

Add tests and documentation updates for **Decision Memo and Documentation**.

---

## Repository Touchpoints

- `tests/unit/`
- `_docs/`

---

## Planned Work

### Regression Scenarios (Required)

1. decision memo completeness path: benchmark outputs and guardrail outcomes are fully captured.
2. traceability path: every recommendation links to measured scenarios.
3. no-go/go path: decision outcomes are reproducible from stored evidence.
4. docs path: experiment constraints and exclusions are explicitly documented.

### Metrics To Capture

- benchmark scenario coverage in decision memo
- recommendation-to-evidence traceability ratio
- documentation completeness checklist pass rate

### Documentation Deliverables

- update task-linked docs with a before/after summary tied to the captured metrics
- document exact test commands, fixtures, and profile/config used during validation
- record compatibility or migration notes when behavior differs between surfaces

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- all required regression scenarios are implemented and passing in CI/local test runs
- metrics are captured with baseline vs post-change values and attached to the task update
- docs include the regression matrix and explain expected behavior boundaries
- no untracked regressions are observed on related router/dispatcher/platform paths

---

## Atomic Work Items

1. Implement the required regression scenarios in focused unit/integration tests.
2. Run the target suites, collect metric outputs, and compare to baseline values.
3. Update docs with regression matrix, metric table, and migration/compatibility notes.
4. Verify adjacent surfaces for spillover regressions and document the result.
