# TASK-089-04-01-02: Workflow Catalog Contracts

**Parent:** [TASK-089-04-01](./TASK-089-04-01_Core_Router_Workflow_Execution_Report.md)  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Priority:** 🔴 High  

**Administrative Note:** Closed with the completed parent implementation wave. The planning sections below are retained as historical slice notes.

**Depends On:** [TASK-089-04](./TASK-089-04_Router_Workflow_and_Execution_Report_Contracts.md)  

---

## Objective

Implement the **Workflow Catalog Contracts** slice of the parent task.

---

## Repository Touchpoints

- `server/adapters/mcp/contracts/workflow_catalog.py`
- `server/application/tool_handlers/workflow_catalog_handler.py`
- `server/adapters/mcp/areas/workflow_catalog.py`

---

## Planned Work

### Slice Outputs

- define concrete contract envelopes/schemas for the target capability family
- wire contracts through handler/adapter integration without changing domain ownership
- ensure renderer/serialization paths preserve structured-first guarantees

### Implementation Checklist

- touch `server/adapters/mcp/contracts/workflow_catalog.py` with explicit change notes and boundary rationale
- touch `server/application/tool_handlers/workflow_catalog_handler.py` with explicit change notes and boundary rationale
- touch `server/adapters/mcp/areas/workflow_catalog.py` with explicit change notes and boundary rationale
- add or update focused regression coverage for the slice behavior
- capture before/after evidence tied to the slice outputs

### Review Notes To Attach

- rationale per changed touchpoint and any explicit no-change decisions
- exact test commands and profile/config context used during validation
- deferred work list with safety rationale

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- contract schemas are explicit, stable, and test-covered
- handler->adapter mapping is deterministic and backward-compatible where required
- invalid payloads fail fast with contract-level errors
- slice contracts are ready for higher-level audit/versioning integration

---

## Atomic Work Items

1. Implement schema/envelope definitions and integration in listed touchpoints.
2. Add contract tests for valid payloads, invalid payloads, and compatibility mode.
3. Capture representative before/after payload examples.
4. Document required and optional fields with ownership notes.
