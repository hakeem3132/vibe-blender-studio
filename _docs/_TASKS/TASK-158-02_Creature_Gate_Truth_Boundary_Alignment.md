# TASK-158-02: Creature Gate Truth Boundary Alignment

**Status:** ✅ Done
**Priority:** 🔴 High
**Parent:** [TASK-158](./TASK-158_Vision_And_Creature_Gate_Boundary_Doc_Alignment.md)
**Category:** Documentation / Creature Gate Boundary
**Estimated Effort:** Small

## Objective

Align the creature reconstruction task docs with the `TASK-157` rule that
Vision, reference, and perception outputs are advisory proposal/support context,
while scene, spatial, mesh, assertion, and verifier evidence owns gate status
and final completion truth.

## Repository Touchpoints

| Path / Module | Expected Change |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `_docs/_TASKS/TASK-135_Anatomy_Aware_Reference_Guided_Low_Poly_Creature_Reconstruction.md` | Replace reference/perception truth wording with verifier-owned truth |
| `_docs/_TASKS/TASK-135-03_Low_Poly_Form_Refinement_Mesh_Window_And_Profile_Macros.md` | Replace standalone reference-evidence wording with normalized gate evidence and verifier-supported support refs |
| `_docs/_TASKS/TASK-157_Goal_Derived_Quality_Gates_And_Deterministic_Verification.md` | Read-only source of the generic gate/verifier boundary |

## Implementation Notes

- `TASK-135` should remain the domain consumer. Do not move creature-specific
  relation policy into `TASK-157`.
- Vision Mode may define labels, relation vocabulary, and candidate findings,
  but it must not decide true attachment or cleanup status by itself.
- Shape-profile child gates in `TASK-135-03` should come from normalized gate
  evidence and verifier-supported support refs.
- Preserve the low-poly creature product goal; only tighten authority wording.

## Runtime / Security Contract Notes

- This is a docs-only cleanup. It must not change guided runtime behavior,
  public MCP parameters, router metadata, visibility policy, or verifier code.
- Stdio and Streamable HTTP behavior must remain unchanged.
- No provider call, perception sidecar activation, SAM/CLIP/SigLIP adapter, or
  model download is part of this task.
- Documentation examples must not include raw provider payloads, secrets, local
  private paths, or unredacted debug transcripts.
- The cleanup must preserve verifier-owned gate truth: creature Vision Mode may
  propose relation findings, but scene/spatial/mesh/assertion evidence,
  evaluated by the quality-gate verifier, owns pass/fail status.

## Anchor-Based Targets

Exact line numbers in the downstream creature docs may drift after each wording
cleanup. Refresh exact locations against the current checkout before editing and
start from these anchor groups:

| Anchor | Required Work |
|--------|---------------|
| The first `TASK-157` authority bullet cluster in `TASK-135` | Replace pass/fail authority wording with scene/spatial/mesh/assertion/verifier truth |
| The Vision Mode / relation-mismatch decision section in `TASK-135` | Rewrite true-error wording as advisory relation findings bound by verifier/spatial/assertion policy |
| The `shape_profile` child-gate paragraph in `TASK-135-03` | Replace standalone `reference evidence requires them` wording with normalized gate evidence and verifier-supported support refs |

## Rewrite Pattern

```text
Before:
deterministic scene/spatial/mesh/reference evidence decides whether the gate passed

After:
scene/spatial/mesh/assertion evidence, evaluated by the quality-gate verifier,
decides whether the gate passed; reference and perception outputs may seed
proposals or attach bounded support refs when the verifier strategy accepts
them.
```

```text
Before:
Vision defines true attachment errors and true cleanup/intersection errors.

After:
Vision records advisory relation-mismatch candidates; verifier, spatial, and
assertion policy bind those findings to attachment or cleanup gate status.
```

```text
Before:
shape-profile child gates apply where reference evidence requires them.

After:
shape-profile child gates come from normalized gate evidence and
verifier-supported support refs, not standalone reference evidence.
```

## Tests / Validation

- `git diff --check`
- `rg -n "scene/spatial/mesh/reference evidence|true attachment errors|true cleanup/intersection errors|reference evidence requires" _docs/_TASKS/TASK-135*.md`
  - expected result after completion: no hits, unless explicitly quoted as a
    before/after pattern in completed task notes
- `rg -n "scene/spatial/mesh/assertion|verifier-supported|advisory relation" _docs/_TASKS/TASK-135*.md`
  - expected result after completion: confirms replacement wording is present

## Docs To Update

- `_docs/_TASKS/TASK-135_Anatomy_Aware_Reference_Guided_Low_Poly_Creature_Reconstruction.md`
- `_docs/_TASKS/TASK-135-03_Low_Poly_Form_Refinement_Mesh_Window_And_Profile_Macros.md`

## Changelog Impact

- If this leaf closes independently, add a scoped `_docs/_CHANGELOG/*` entry in
  the same branch and update `_docs/_CHANGELOG/README.md`.
- If multiple `TASK-158` leaves land together in one wave, one shared
  completion entry may cover them, but it must name this leaf explicitly and
  record its validation in the summary.
- Changelog 278 remains the creation/plan entry.

## Status / Board Update

- This leaf stays under `TASK-158`; do not add a separate promoted board row.
- When this slice closes, record the repaired `TASK-135*` ranges in the parent
  completion summary and leave `_docs/_TASKS/README.md` tracking on the
  umbrella task only.
- Do not leave this leaf open under a closed `TASK-158`. If any creature-scope
  boundary repair is intentionally deferred, convert that remainder into a
  standalone `Follow-on After` task, update `_docs/_TASKS/README.md` to track
  it, and close or supersede this leaf with an explicit reason in the same
  branch.

## Acceptance Criteria

- TASK-135 no longer grants reference/perception evidence pass/fail authority.
- TASK-135 Vision Mode is advisory until verifier/spatial/assertion policy
  binds a finding to gate status.
- TASK-135-03 uses normalized gate evidence and verifier-supported refs for
  shape-profile gates.

## Completion Summary

- completed on 2026-05-03 as a validated no-op docs closeout: the current
  `TASK-135*` wording already matches the `TASK-157` authority split
- confirmed there are no remaining hits for the drift phrases
  `scene/spatial/mesh/reference evidence`, `true attachment errors`,
  `true cleanup/intersection errors`, or `reference evidence requires`
- kept this leaf as done because the intended boundary repair is now present in
  the live task docs, even though no additional wording patch was required in
  this wave
- validated with:
  `git diff --check`
  and
  `rg -n "scene/spatial/mesh/reference evidence|true attachment errors|true cleanup/intersection errors|reference evidence requires" _docs/_TASKS/TASK-135*.md`
